# Gasoline!
Welcome to the Gasoline Project!


## What is Gasoline?


**Gasoline** is a game engine I am developing to teach myself computer graphics and to further my knowledge of game programming.


## Motivation
Like many others, I was first drawn to computer science by my curiosity about the inner workings of video games. I quickly realized that video game development is no simple task. Due to their multifaceted nature, modern video games are often developed by teams of people, all with different skill sets. Writers, artists, musicians, actors, level designers, programmers, all of these people contribute their individual talents to produce a cohesive gaming experience. In order to pull this off a game development team must be adept at interdisciplinary collaboration. This is where utilizing a game engine can be immensely beneficial. So, what is a Game Engine? The answer to this question seems to vary depending on who you ask. However, for this project I will be sticking with this fairly loose definition.


> "**Game Engine:** A software or set of softwares designed to aid in the creation
> of video games."
 
A well designed game engine abstracts away the more technical systems used in video games such as rendering, and provides a clean API/interface/set of tools that allow for the various members on a game development team to create what they need and easily integrate it into the final game. So in a nutshell, **A game engine should seek to allow creatives to make what they need to make by eliminating the headache of having to worry about complex technical details.** However, I am someone who happens to be very interested in these technical details. I have often found myself messing around with low level game frameworks or attempting to program small engines. However, these projects always end up abandoned after a few weeks with little to nothing to show. In order to avoid **Gasoline** suffering from the same fate, I have decided to make it a public project for the duration of its development. This should, hopefully, put some pressure on me to maintain a clean and well documented codebase. In turn this will allow for a smoother development process. This approach will also make it easier to document my progress as I continue to learn new things and implement new features. By giving myself a clear view of my progress I can be inspired by my work and have a clear vision of where to go next. In essence, **Gasoline is a self assessment to see if I actually have the capability to build a game engine without giving up and quitting part way through.**


## Who is Gasoline For?
**Gasoline is primarily a personal project.** It exists primarily to further my own knowledge of game engine technology and software development. The entire reason for the project's public facing nature is to put pressure on myself to keep the project maintained and organized. This means that  **Gasoline** is NOT intended for use in actual production. In case it has not become abundantly clear let me state that **I have no idea what I am doing!** I am still very new to game engine programming so nothing in this project is guaranteed to work correctly or be implemented in a quality manner. I can (and probably will) be making large compatibility breaking changes frequently as I continue to learn and improve. This also means that Gasoline should not be treated as any kind of comprehensive tutorial or guide on the proper way to build a game engine. However, **Gasoline** is distributed under the WTFPL license. So if for whatever reason you do see some value in what I am doing, You are free to use anything in this repository however you wish.


## Contributing to Gasoline
As previously stated, Gasoline is primarily a personal project. **I have no intentions of collaborating with any other developers or accepting any pull requests at this time.** In order to maximize my learning I want to implement as much of the engine as I can myself. That being said, **Feedback and constructive criticism is not only welcome but it is encouraged.** Feel free to suggest new features and improvements as well as report any bugs or glitches you may find. You are also welcome to insult and critique my code using whatever colorful vocabulary you find necessary.


## What's with the name?
I chose the name **Gasoline** because I am making a Game Engine. And from what I understand, *It is gasoline that keeps engines running.* I set this project up to be a form of self motivation. In this regard **The Gasoline Project** act's as fuel for me to continue learning and developing this project. *Just as gasoline is fuel for an engine this project is fuel for my education.*. Of course the main reason I chose the name **Gasoline** is because it just sounds super metal! (Also I thought it would be funny to have a codebase with namespace Gas everywhere.)
